# CSC450DjikstrasImplementation
This will be an open-source version of my project that is due in CSC450. 

I will include all source materials and will make it free to clone for anyone.


To get started first look at the problem statement in 'Assignment #5.pdf' and use that as a guide for the problem statement.
I will include a python file that runs from command line which adds all nodes to the network and then takes a node name input and then will find all the shortest paths from that node to all the other nodes.
To run this program from a linux terminal simply write "python OwenSutka_CSC450_Assignment5_Dijkstras.py topology.csv" and then follow the prompts that follow. 

There will be an add-on that allows you to simply run the program with the line "python OwenSutka_CSC450_Assignment5_Dijkstras.py" and then it will prompt you for the file name and the node.

There is also going to be the add-on that will allow you to specify the node from the command line. Simply write "python OwenSutka_CSC450_Assignment5_Dijkstras.py topology.csv u" to start from node u.
